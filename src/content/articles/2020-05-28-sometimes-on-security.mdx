Several security-focused messaging apps give users the ability to choose
between two modes: unencrypted chats, or end-to-end encrypted ones that might
lack certain features. This is an anti-pattern when it comes to usable
security, and it brings some risks that are rarely discussed.

There are several different implementations of this mixing and matching of
secure and insecure communications. Some chat apps default to unencrypted
messages, but allow users to manually enable end-to-end encryption for
certain threads. Others automatically start a secure channel if the
recipient's client supports the right features -- a type of opportunistic
encryption. Examples of the former include Telegram and Facebook Messenger:
users must explicitly start a "secret chat" if they want end-to-end
encryption. In the other category, you have apps like [Delta
Chat](https://delta.chat/en/) -- an email-based instant messenger that uses
[Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/) to automate PGP key distribution and
message encryption. Even Signal, which is generally celebrated for its strong
security, can be used as the default SMS app on Android phones -- allowing it
to send plaintext text messages to contacts who don't use Signal. "Secure"
email providers like ProtonMail also fall into this category.

This probably doesn't sound so bad. After all, encrypting _some_ messages is
better than encrypting none, and users who have high security needs can just
enable the encryption features they want, right? Unfortunately, this does not
accurately represent how users understand and use secure communication tools.

## Communication problems

The core problem is that communicating security features to end users is
_hard_. There are often nuances and conditions that are opaque unless you're a
technical user with significant security knowledge. For example: in Delta
Chat, messages are only encrypted if the recipient also uses a client with
Autocrypt, and messages are never encrypted before you've received a response
(with the other party's public key as a header). It's not easy to inform
users of these conditions, and the communication difficulties are not unique
to Delta Chat: PGP without Autocrypt is famously opaque and difficult to
use[^1] and key verification in modern messaging apps is often done
incorrectly because users do not understand it[^2].

An obvious solution is to use indicators. Many apps use passive indicators
that don't impede the users' actions, but they let them know that some
security feature is present or missing. The most common passive indicator is
perhaps the lock icon in a browser toolbar indicating a HTTPS connection.
However, studies show that thile users do look at passive indicators[^3],
they are rarely heeded and do not change user behaviour[^4].

In Delta Chat, encrypted messages have a passive indicator in the form of a
small lock icon, but unless you're looking out for it, you won't notice
anything unusual about plaintext messages:

If your friend just told you to download a new, secure communication tool,
you won't know that you have to look out for the lock icon or that you must
enable a specific security feature in the settings. The app might try to tell
you these things, but anyone who's ever seen people rapidly click through
alerts to get to their goal knows that we can't rely on people reading these
in detail. At this point, some might object that it isn't the app developers'
fault if users misrepresent its security features. This is true, but when we
start implementing things like end-to-end encryption, we should expect this
to happen and make sure that the app doesn't let users shoot themselves in
the foot in terms of security.

High-risk users need their communications to be encrypted reliably, and
expecting people to manually verify security features is unfortunately not
very realistic. Telegram is a good example. It markets itself as a secure and
private messenger, but defaults to using plaintext chats. In a usability
study of Telegram, researchers found that while users felt they were using a
secure tool, they were rarely (if ever) using secret chats. Most users did
not understand the difference between the default chat mode and secret chats,
and less than half used secret chats when asked to send sensitive
information[^5].

All messengers that mix insecure and secure modes face the same problem.
Their security relies on users understanding quite a few things, for example
that a key exchange must happen over the initial messages (Delta Chat), or
that messages will only be encrypted if the recipient uses a compatible
client (Signal). Based on what we know from the field of usable security, we
cannot expect end users to keep these security gotchas in mind. As
developers, we should operate under the assumption that any such gotchas will
be misunderstood or forgotten by a significant number of users.

## Binary thinking

In 2017, The Guardian published an alarmist article claiming that WhatApp's
encryption had a backdoor. This was not true -- their article was really
about a reasonable tradeoff made by WhatsApp's developers to balance security
with usability for its two billion users. Their article was quickly met with
[an outcry from security
professionals](http://technosociology.org/?page_id=1687). These experts
pointed out that The Guardian's flawed reporting had caused WhatsApp to be
considered unsafe among some activists and journalists who were instead
switching to far less secure alternatives like SMS. The lesson to be learned
is that when developing messaging apps, we should strive for security that
fits a straightforward mental model: secure or not secure. Of course there
are nuances around threat models, but we must have a reasonable security
baseline -- which it is impossible to provide if your app falls back to
sending unencrypted messages.

There is also non-academic evidence that these are real risks. You'll find
posts from users complaining that they unknowingly sent plaintext messages in
[Delta
Chat](https://support.delta.chat/t/i-just-had-it-happen-that-messages-were-send-unencrypted/526)
and [Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5531). Others
point out that email subject lines may [leak the contents of otherwise
encrypted
messages](https://support.delta.chat/t/possible-thunderbird-gotcha/272)[^6].
A [recent
article](https://www.vodafone.de/featured/apps/delta-chat-app-funktionen-e-mail-test/)
on Delta Chat in a German magazine noted that "of course, all messages are
encrypted" before showing a screenshot of an unencrypted chat.

I'm all for raising the overall level of end-to-end encrypted communications
on the internet, but we need to make sure that we recommend tools that are
appropriate to users' threat models, and that work for non-technical users.
Opportunistic and optional encryption are useful for mitigating mass
surveillance, but high-risk users must be confident that they won't
inadvertently send confidential information over an insecure channel.
Opportunistic and optional encryption cannot provide this guarantee.
