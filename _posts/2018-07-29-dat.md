This website is now available on the peer-to-peer web via the [Dat
protocol](https://www.datprotocol.com/). Link is [here](hyper://f3de5c0ee82333ec6496e864e7cf2681dd5dd711bd6f2bb00a439c03638b829d/). You'll need the [Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) to access the Dat site.

One neat feature: whenever I `jekyll build`, the blog is automatically updated
and live-reloads for anyone currently viewing it. I'm looking forward to working
more with Dat.
