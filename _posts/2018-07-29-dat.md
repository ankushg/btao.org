This website is now available on the peer-to-peer web via the [Dat
protocol](https://www.datprotocol.com/). <!--more-->
Link is [here](dat://btao.org).
You'll need the [Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com)
to access the Dat site.

One neat feature: whenever I `jekyll build`, the blog is automatically updated
and live-reloads for anyone currently viewing it. I'm looking forward to working
more with Dat.
