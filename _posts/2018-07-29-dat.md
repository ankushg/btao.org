This website is now available on the peer-to-peer web via the [Dat
protocol](https://www.datprotocol.com/). Link is
[here](dat://334620b88d1297dd2a4d35f0f7458a6b0a113661ab4a48cf39a1d3747f9a9551/).
You'll need the [Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com)
to access the Dat site.

One neat feature: whenever I `jekyll build`, the blog is automatically updated
and live-reloads for anyone currently viewing it. I'm looking forward to working
more with Dat.
