title: "eusay launch"

I've been working on a project called eusay, where students can submit proposals to the student union and vote/comment on each others' ideas. It has now launched [here](https://eusay.eusa.ed.ac.uk/), and it's also on [GitHub](https://github.com/HughMcGrade/eusay).

eusay is a winner in the 2014 Jisc Summer of Student Innovation. The name is a portmanteau of "EUSA" (the students' union at the University of Edinburgh) and "say".
